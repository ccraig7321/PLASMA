## How it Works

In order for this application to work the user will need to use the terminal to run the program.  This application requires the installation of various dependencies including express, express-handlebars, mysql, and sequelize. These packages assist in handling the dashboard portion of this application.  Additional dependecies including bycrypt, passport, express-session, passort-local, and dotenv are what allow for privacy and authentication throughout the application. When the user runs "node server", there will be a listening PORT assigned to the application. For this case, PLASMA is on local host 3000. The homepage can be viewed by opening the brower to "localhost:3000" or opening the deployed Heroku link.

In order for the user to being the process of accessing the application, the user will need to click on the "Access Your Playlist" button. By doing this, an api call will be made and render the login screen. The login screen gives the user a multitude of of options to chose from. The most obvious is the option for the user to enter a username and password and select the "Login" button.  Entering in the username and password generates a session through the passport npm package.  The session is what links to the database in MySql and allows access to the rest of the application.

The user also has the option select an action located at the bottom of the login page.  If the user needs assistance, he/she will be able to click on the "Need Help?" button. This will route the user to the "Contact Us" page which gives the user the ability to send a message to the developers via email. From this page, the user will be able to return to the homepage by selecting the "PLASMA" icon on the top left portion of the navigation bar, singup for membership by selecting "Sign Up" on the right side, or login/logout by making a selections from the dropdown "User" menu.

The final option the user will be able to select is the "Sign Up" button.  This redirects the user to the "Signup" page where the user will be prompted to enter a name, email address, and password in order to create an account. Making a new user creates a new user in the MySql database. Each new user is assigned an id in the table. This allows for data to be populated to specific users once logged into the application.

In order to create a new playlist, the user will need type in a title for the playlist and then select the "New Playlist" button. Doing this will store that information in the MySql database under the unique id that was assigned to that particular user.
